## component
- 2 RGB neopixel ring 12 (robot eyelid)
- 2 RGB neopixel jwel 7 (robot Cornea)
- 1 Arduino uno
- 2 PIR sensor (can add more for smooth Eye movement)
- wires

## How it works 
I decided instead of using the normal LED, using these pieces in the ThinkerCad, and simply the ring represents the eyelid of the robin, and the jwel represents the cornea, which will move according to the sensor of the PIR sensor, and it is better to use the IR detector instead of the PIR, and the more sensors there are, the more In the possibility of making the movement of the robotâ€™s eye smoothly follow the moving object in front of it, and an important note is that an insulating body must be used between each sensor so that the readings do not interfere, and it is better than using these sensors to use a camera to track the eye or face more precisely. And the best of using the neopixle is using LED screens.
